The input text and target text focus on the specific aspect of an article being published under a dateline, while the generated text adds the detail of countable and newspaper, which is not present in the input or target text.

Yes , Barcombe and Glynde I think . \n    target text: (Sussex) A visit by one bonfire society to join in with the celebrations of another.\n    generated text: Alternative form of outfire\nThere are two criteria for hallucination:\n    If the generated text contatins any nonsensical or factually incorrect information, it is a hallucination.\n    If the generated text contains additional information that cannot be supported by the input text or the target text, it is a hallucination.\nOtherwise, the generated text is not a hallucination.\nA lexicographer evaluated the generated text looking at the input text and the target text. The lexicographer decided that the generated text is \"Hallucination\".\nHere is the reasoning the lexicographer provided: The generated text Alternative form of outfire does not accurately define the term in the context of the input text and the target text. The target text refers to a specific event involving bonfire societies, while the generated text merely presents outfire as an alternative form without providing the relevant meaning. Additionally, the generated text does not align with the input text, which implies a specific event or location related to outfires. Thus, the generated text contains additional information that cannot be supported by the input text or the target text, making it a hallucination.\nThis is the probability assigned by the lexicographer: 0.95\n",
